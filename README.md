# Cart-with-Sequelize-Express-and-jQuery

A simple shopping list application, where you can add Product Name, Manufacturer Name and Price of product and that will be stored into Database.

Created API with Express which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Used Sequelize library, Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. With Sequelize, you don't need to write SQL anymore, it allows you create objects.

In this case for sequelize, MySQL must be downloaded and running in your computer.

Used jQuery for DOM and AJAX Calls as well.

To install Sequelize, MySQL and Express you need to run:

"npm init" for initialzing

"npm i express" for installing express into folder

"npm i mysql2" for installing mysql
